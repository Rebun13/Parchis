# Parchis

This is my first independent game. The idea is to implement a Parchis online multiplayer game, at first with the basic rules, and later implementing new game modes with special rules.

## Tech stack

I am using Raylib, a little C++ library for videogame development. Since this is my first independent project as a videogame developer, I think it is a great opportunity to learn C++ in a videogame environment, and also can work great as a showcase of how I work.

## Platform

I plan on launch this as a free Android game.
